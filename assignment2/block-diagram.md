# Exercise 2.1 Idea Project Diagram

## Description
It is the concept for a firmware block diagram for a wireless fiber photometry system. Fiber photometry is used to flouesce biomolecules located in deep structures within the brain. Typically, the hardware is mounted on an optical bench that is connected to an optical fiber that is embedded with a mouse brain. The following hardware block diagram shows the peripherals connected to a MCU to show which block is responsible for which feature.
