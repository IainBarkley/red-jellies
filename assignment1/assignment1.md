# Lesson 1 Assignment

## Invent an Imaginary Embedded System

Tell us about an embedded system that does not exist. It can be grandiose or strange; it can be
something just one step beyond what you have around you. Ideally it is something you
personally want to build (even if physics doesn’t allow it). What is it? What does it do? What
general components do you need?

This should be summarized in 3-6 sentences. A diagram would be nice but not required.
Write your idea in a Google doc or a md file on Github and submit your assignment link to the
#assignment-submission channel on Discord. Make sure your submission is publicly viewable.

## Problem Statement
Optogenetics became explosively popular
for controlling animal behaviour in-vivo,
however, recently this technology was
applied for in-vitro cells or tissues for
controlling gene expression.
For this purpose, long-term and
time-controlled light stimulation in a
culture incubator is required..
This full  LED array fulfills
all the requirements for the in-vitro
optogenetics experiments


To be feasible, the following requirements need to be met:

* Total irradiance no less than 
* Deployable to measure a 625 square meter area with a granularity of 1 meter
* Able to withstand a current 
* Acquire temperature measurements with a precision of 0.5 degree C and an accuracy of +/- 0.5 degree C
* Transfer temperature sensor measurements wirelessly to a collection station 1/2 km away, or, store sensor readings and transfer them out optically
* Transfer temperature sensor measurements at a minimum sampling rate of 120 seconds
* Transfer temperature sensor measurements securely
* Operate in an outdoor environment with full exposure to the elements (NEMA 6)
* Operate in a thermal environment ranging from -10C to 40C
* Easily be geo-registered using a mobile phone

If a low-cost temperature monitoring “mote”, which can be inexpensively deployed into the field, is designed and manufactured, it will enable many applications in agriculture, forestry, and other fields where dense medium resolution temperature sensing is required that are currently cost prohibitive.
