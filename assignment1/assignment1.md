# Lesson 1 Assignment

## Invent an Imaginary Embedded System

Tell us about an embedded system that does not exist. It can be grandiose or strange; it can be
something just one step beyond what you have around you. Ideally it is something you
personally want to build (even if physics doesnâ€™t allow it). What is it? What does it do? What
general components do you need?

This should be summarized in 3-6 sentences. A diagram would be nice but not required.
Write your idea in a Google doc or a md file on Github and submit your assignment link to the
#assignment-submission channel on Discord. Make sure your submission is publicly viewable.

## Problem Statement
Optogenetics is a tool for allowing direct control of cellular function by using direct light stimulation. This is typically achieved by targeting cells of interest with  engineered light-sensitive channels using genetic techniques. These light sensitive channels are typically developed using directed evolution in yeast cell culture where the light sensitive channels are steered towards a targeted parameter, such as blah or blah. The channels with the right parameters are in turn are tagged with a green fluorescent molecule (GFP) which fluoresces in the presence of UV light. 

The optogenetics box is designed for screening multiple wells of yeast culture using a programmable, configurable LED array which allows the user to select the well with the highest fluoresenct intensity. The opto-chamber is also climate controlled for adaptability in an incubation chamber. 

To be feasible, the following requirements need to be met:

* Total irradiance no less than 
* Drive 12 700 mA LEDS with a inhomogeneity less than 
* Operate in a thermal environment ranging from 20 C to 50C
* Operate with a relative humidity from 0 to 100 %
* Chamber must have a viewing camera that allows the user to see the 
* Chamber must report temperature and humidity to user.
*
